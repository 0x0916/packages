nvidia-detect - a utility to detect NVIDIA graphics cards

nvidia-detect is a utility to detect NVIDIA graphics cards. The utility will
probe the PCI bus for NVIDIA devices and search for matching devices against a
list of supported device_ids. nvidia-detect will make a recommendation for the
correct driver to use based on any matches found. For example:

$ nvidia-detect
Probing for supported NVIDIA devices...
[10de:0ca3] NVIDIA Corporation GT215 [GeForce GT 240]
This device requires the current NVIDIA driver (kmod-nvidia).

$ nvidia-detect
Probing for supported NVIDIA devices...
[10de:0392] NVIDIA Corporation G73 [GeForce 7600 GS]
This device requires the legacy 304.xx NVIDIA driver (kmod-nvidia-304xx).

nvidia-detect may be run from within a script and will return the following codes:

0: No supported devices found
1: Device supported by the current 319.32 NVIDIA driver
2: Device supported by the legacy 96.xx NVIDIA driver
3: Device supported by the legacy 173.xx NVIDIA driver
4: Device supported by the legacy 304.xx NVIDIA driver
